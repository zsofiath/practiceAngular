# Practicing angular
In this repo I solve small tasks in angular.

## Tooltip dropdown
A button appears on the screen. On hover a tooltip appears next to it, which is a selectable list at the same time. If a list item has info key with a string (other than empty string), it must have a settable info icon which opens tooltip on hover.

AC:
```diff
- A button appears with a default text given as input

- A tooltip appears on clicking the input, and dissapears when clicking anywhere but the tooltip

- The tooltip has an arrow pointing right to the button

- The tooltip must not go out from the window

- A list appears in the tooltip

- The list is scrollable (custom design, works with mouse and scroll)

- If the list item has an 'info' key it must have a hoverable area (can be icon) which opens a tooltip on hover

- The info tooltip must not go out from the window, but must appear righ next to the info indicator

```
