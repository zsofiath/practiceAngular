# Practicing angular
In this repo I solve small tasks in angular.

## Tooltip dropdown
A button appears on the screen. On hover a tooltip appears next to it, which is a selectable list at the same time. If a list item has info key with a string (other than empty string), it must have a settable info icon which opens tooltip on hover.
